    "Our project explores access to higher education for students in Massachusetts public schools. Specifically, we want to better understand what qualities make a school district more likely to have higher rates of students who go on to attend college or university. \n",

    "Our first objective is to better understand the correlation between school district characteristics and access to higher education within that district. Another objective is to run several regression models on the data and determine how altering school district qualities impacts students' access to higher ed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Significance of the Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "Access to higher education is foundational in creating a more equitable society, something our group is quite passionate about. Having a college degree means you have access to a larger number of high-paying jobs and potentially will have a higher quality of life. At the same time, not every public school district is created equal. For example, some may have more funding, better teachers or different disciplinary policies, which could affect students’ likelihood to go to college. \n",
    "\n",
    "The insights from this project can be useful for decision makers who are trying to better equip school districts to send students on to higher education. If these decision makers understand the characteristics that most impact access to higher education, they can form regulations and distribute resources in a way most likely to create more equitable public education systems across the state.\n",
