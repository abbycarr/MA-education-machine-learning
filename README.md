# MA-education-machine-learning
A machine learning project to predict the percentage of high school graduates that will attend college or university given information for a school district

#### Description
This project is for DS3000, the Foundations of Data Science, and is described as, "a life-like DS project in which you identify a problem and dataset; clean, process, and prepare the dataset for analysis; analyze and visualize the data using Python libraries; and report your findings and insights for decision making."

The project will be updated as we work with our dataset and apply machine learning techniques.
