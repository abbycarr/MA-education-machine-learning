# MA-education-machine-learning
A machine learning project to predict the percentage of high school graduates that will attend college or university given information for a school district

### Description
This project is for DS3000, the Foundations of Data Science, and is described as, "a life-like DS project in which you identify a problem and dataset; clean, process, and prepare the dataset for analysis; analyze and visualize the data using Python libraries; and report your findings and insights for decision making."

The project will be updated as we work with our dataset and apply machine learning techniques.

### The Dataset:
The datasets was compiled from various sets of data available from the Massachusetts Department of Education on school districts in a given year. Each row of pre-existing data is the data for a MA school district over a single school year.

Take a look at the Dataset Information file (to be uploaded by Monday, Nov. 2nd) to view a complete project description along with specific information on our dataset values and its machine learning potential.
